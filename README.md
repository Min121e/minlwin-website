# Min Lwin's portfolio website

I made a portfolio website for a friend of mine so that he can showcase his skills and the projects that he made. 

Live page ([MinLwin's-project](https://golden-sawine-e53f38.netlify.app/))

## Tools used

- React JS
- Tailwind
- React router
- lightbox2

## About this project

I used Reactjs to develop this project and used tailwind to style it. 

In the project sections, I used lightbox2 library in the first project so that the user can see the image clearly and swipe left or right.
